- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tom-Orusa I have got a PhD in Earth Observation from space and Remote Sesing at the Department of Agricultural, Forest and Food Sciences at the University of Turin (Italy) (https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6750-0438)
- 👀 I’m interested in Remote Sensing applied to One Health and Forestry-Environmental Sciences, Geostatistics, Google Earth Engine, Machine Learning including AI geospatial analysis, R, Phyton and Earth Observation apps.
- 🌱 I’m currently a GIS & Remote Sensing Specialist at INVA spa (https://www.invallee.it/Home) and Researcher at Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise "G. Caporale" (https://www.izs.it/IZS/Engine/RAServePG.php/P/250010010603/L/1)   
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborate on Google Earth Engine projects and R packages as well as algorithms/models that deal with EO data and more in general in R&D communities with Machine Learning in Earth Observation topics.
